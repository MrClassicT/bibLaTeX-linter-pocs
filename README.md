# Linter for BibLaTeX
> By Tristan Cuvelier

Some proof of concepts for my general proof of concept BibLaTeX Linter can be found here.
This is being developed for my bachelor's thesis in applied IT.

This repo will be made public once the thesis has ended.

These are all uncomplete and just small portions of what ended up to be Bibla. Bibla is an extension on Bibl by Arne Van Den Kerckhove.

For BibTex validation, I can recommend Bibl and for BibLaTeX validation I can suggest my own version of Bibl, named Bibla. Both are available to install through pip.

This repo has been made public solely for the purpose of sharing knowledge and experiences. I am aware that certain things may either not work nor be fully optimized.
